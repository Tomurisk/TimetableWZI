# TimetableWZI
Timetable**WZI** (*Timetable **with Zoom integration***) is a simple console application to ease the management of school subjects, while providing an efficient way of accessing Zoom remote classes.

# Requirements
This program was built using Visual Studio 2019 and written in C++, therefore a [32-bit Visual C++ 2015-2019 redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) is required. It should be already present in most systems running Windows 10.

[Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download) is also required as the program will ask the user to input Zoom links, which will later be converted into arguments for launching Zoom meetings.
